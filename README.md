# PyGAD

[PyGAD](https://pypi.org/project/pygad) is an open-source Python 3 library for implementing the genetic algorithm and optimizing machine learning algorithms. 

[PyGAD](https://pypi.org/project/pygad) supports different types of crossover, mutation, and parent selection. [PyGAD](https://pypi.org/project/pygad) allows different types of problems to be optimized using the genetic algorithm by customizing the fitness function. 

Besides building the genetic algorithm, it builds and optimizes machine learning algorithms. Currently, [PyGAD](https://pypi.org/project/pygad) supports building and training (using genetic algorithm) artificial neural networks for classification problems. 

The library is under active development and more features in the genetic algorithm will be added like working with binary problems. This is in addition to supporting more machine learning algorithms.

# Tutorial Project

**IMPORTANT** If you are coming for the code of the tutorial titled  [**Genetic Algorithm Implementation in Python**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/genetic-algorithm-implementation-python-ahmed-gad), then it has been moved to the [Tutorial Project](https://github.com/ahmedfgad/GeneticAlgorithmPython/tree/master/Tutorial Project) directory on 06 May 2020.

# Installation

To install [PyGAD](https://pypi.org/project/pygad), simply use pip to download and install the library from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pygad) (Python Package Index). The library lives a PyPI at this page https://pypi.org/project/pygad.

For Windows, issue the following command:

```python
pip install pygad
```

For Linux and Mac, replace `pip` by use `pip3` because the library only supports Python 3.

```python
pip3 install pygad
```

PyGAD is developed in Python 3.7.3 and depends on NumPy for creating and manipulating arrays and Matplotlib for creating figures. The exact NumPy version used in developing PyGAD is 1.16.4. For Matplotlib, the version is 3.1.0.

To get started with PyGAD, please read the documentation at [Read The Docs](https://pygad.readthedocs.io/) https://pygad.readthedocs.io.
